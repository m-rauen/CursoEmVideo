### Basic Information

---

Here are all the files with the solved problems proposed throughout the courses that I take, the files are separed into different directories, since the whole Python course have 3 separated modules (Mundo1, Mundo2, Mundo3). Since the files from the algorithm course are in portugol language, I decided to just upload the challenges that were solved. 

Some files contain insights and hints from when I was learning programming basics, logic and little bit of algorithm, so, I thought would be nice and interesting to upload it all here.
